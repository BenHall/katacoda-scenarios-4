## Dockerfile

**Objective:** Participants will learn to Dockerize applications, create Docker images by using a Dockerfile, and get a more complete look at individual commands we can utilize.<br>

**Preparation:** Open two Terminal windows, and `cd` into the appropriate Lab folder.<br>

**Outcome:** Don't wanna ruin the surprise, but once you're done you'll have dockerized a C application and learn about Dockerfiles useing Figlet, which is a cool, custom made image for learning.<br>

**Data Files:** ```Dockerfile, helloworld.c``` (Both are created during the lab.)

#### Conclusion 
We've covered a lot, and we have opened several cans of worms in the process. In a nutshell this has been only a small introduction into the use cases and benefits involved in using Dockerfiles. At least now we know how to create a Dockerfile, build it, explore the history, add commands, entry points, and how to copy entire apps in. This is not increditible easy stuff. Now, do a reset and let's move on. Congrats!
