1\. Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory and paste the following:

    ```yaml
    version: 'X' //Use the chart above to make your selection.
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        ports:
         - 5000:5000
        volumes:
         - .:/code
      redis:
        image: "redis:alpine"
    ```

This Compose file defines two services, `web` and `redis`. The web service:
- Uses an image thatâ€™s built from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
- Forwards the exposed port 5000 on the container to port 5000 on the host machine.
- Mounts the project directory on the host to `/code` inside the container, allowing you to modify the code without having to rebuild the image.
- The `redis` service uses a public Redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.
